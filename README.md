# mechanic-data

In this project, we modeled and built a database for a mechanic shop. The system will be used to track information about customers, cars, mechanics, car ownership, service request, and billing information. The project is divided into three phases:

(i) ER Design: In this phase, we individually generated an ER-diagram using the requirement analysis that was given in the documentation.

(ii) Relational Schema Design: After being provided a common (and final) ER-diagram, the second phase involves the creation of the relational schema. Similar to phase (i), this part is also done individually

(iii) Implementation: Our main objective was to develop a client application using the Java Database Connector (jdbc) for psql. The client application supports specific functionality and queries for the entire online booking system.
